	<h1>Ways to Learn About and Support BIPOC</h1>

	<div class="main_content">
		<h2>What does BIPOC mean?</h2>
		<p>BIPOC stands for Black, Indigenous, and People of Color.</p>
		<p>According to the <a href="https://www.thebipocproject.org/" target="_blank">BIPOC Project</a> - who coined the term BIPOC - "We use the term BIPOC to highlight 
			the unique relationship to whiteness that Indigenous and Black (African Americans) people have, 
			which shapes the experiences of and relationship to white supremacy for all people of color within a 
			U.S. context."	
		</p>
		<p>While Black and Indigenous groups fall into the category of
			"People of Color," many people differentiate them from the broader 
			category to emphasize that Black and Indigenous groups suffer more as a result
			of systemic White supremacy. It is important to note that while all people of color deal with the consequnces 
			of white supremacy, "not all people of color face the same levels of injustice" (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/diversifyournarrative/"
			target="_blank">Diversify Our Narrative</a>).
		</p>
		<h2>Why do we care?</h2>
		<p>We just should. There's no reason not to care about other people.</p>
		<p>In order to make a more fair world in which we fight the systemic racial
			oppression of society, we must amplify and learn about voices that often go 
			unheard in public spaces.
		</p>
		<h2>What you can find on this site</h2>
		<p>Books, Films, and FOOD!!!</p>
		<p>We compiled books and films written and/or directed by BIPOC authors 
			with BIPOC protagonists/leads. Some of them are based on real-life events; however, all
			of them speak to BIPOC experiences. And we also found some restaurants or other 
			places to get food, all owned by people identifying as BIPOC - and all the food places 
			have vegetarian (and sometimes vegan) options.</p>
